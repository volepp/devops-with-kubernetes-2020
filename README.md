## Google Cloud SQL vs DIY Postgres

Up to this point, self-hosted Postgres has been used in previous exercises which of course enables us to proceed with using it with somewhat more of a routine.
This would avoid the overhead that comes from learning Google Cloud SQL in the beginning since I have no experience of using it before. So, considering the cost and the time it would take to initialize the database in the first place, I suspect hosting Postgres by ourselves would be at least a slightly faster way to go.

We have to, however, consider other factors that could influence the decision as well. One of those factors is the maintenance of the database.
